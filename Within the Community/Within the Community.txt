Within the Community
-Blank Carrier to be Occupied



How Does Architecture Shape Neighborhood Atmosphere?
In relation to weakness, our definition of strength is a spatial clear-cut that
appears hidden. This project explores how architectural spaces can carry
various functions and activities while allowing different activities to interact
and overlap within the same carrier. The resulting spatial layering creates
a sense of ambiguity where spaces seem to occupy each other. Through
vertical organization and careful manipulation of levels, the design creates
distinct spatial conditions while maintaining visual connections.
The architecture becomes a framework that orchestrates public and
private realms - each space flows into the next while retaining its individual
character. This spatial strategy responds to urban community dynamics
where privacy and publicness need to be delicately balanced, creating an
urban interface that supports both collective and individual experiences.



Fluid Voids
The unidirectional folded plate structure guides the flow of
movement and visual experience, while the gaps between
the plates allow sound and light to transmit between
floors. At the urban scale, the building acts as an openended
structure, seamlessly merging with the city fabric and
fostering dynamic spatial connections.

Sectional Elevation
From the perspective of the alleys, the building’s elevation
reveals the ever-changing movement of its interior spaces
across day and night. This transparency connects the life of
the neighborhood, allowing diverse community activities to
flow fluidly between the inside and outside spaces.
