Co-Living Landscape
The Wholeness and Fragmentation of Daily Life

How to Create Seamless Spatial Connections?
The project explores the relationship between urban interfaces and
domestic life through architectural form composition. Starting from the
setback entrance hall, multi-level balconies, to rooftop gardens, each
threshold is carefully defined to mediate between city and home. The
design creates a continuous spatial sequence that responds to both
urban context and family activities, reimagining domestic scenes through
strategic interfaces.
The architecture becomes a framework of overlapping spaces where
daily life unfolds. Through careful composition of voids, split-levels, and
transparent boundaries, the design creates a domestic mise-en-sc√®ne that
orchestrates visual and physical connections while maintaining spatial
hierarchy. This spatial choreography transforms routine moments into
fluid experiences, balancing privacy and togetherness in contemporary
living.


Half Room
Each room in this house is designed as a half room - a
trapezoidal unit that relies on shared spaces to become
whole. The transition spaces such as entrance halls,
gardens, balconies, staircases, and corridors weave through
different rooms, creating interwoven living experiences and
continuous spatial narratives.

Flow Between Spaces
Activities flow through spaces in a continuous sequence, forming a fluid co-living landscape.
From the entrance hall, children's play echoes through the void above the living room, while
ascending stairs reveals kitchen activities and an herb garden balcony. The third floor children's
bedrooms open to a light-filled sky garden. Split-level floors and strategic voids create visual
and acoustic connections, weaving together daily family interactions across different spaces.
