介紹 

Chao Tang Lin is a Taiwanese architect and researcher based in New York, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Advanced Architectural Design at Columbia GSAPP (’26). His professional experience at KRIS YAO | ARTECH involved large-scale institutional and cultural projects, urban renewal strategies, and heritage reviews, grounding his design practice in both technical rigor and contextual sensitivity. His research explores the intersections of temporality, waste, ecology, and adaptation, reframing the relationship between body, environment, and architecture. Through design and critical inquiry, he seeks to cultivate new ways of perceiving and inhabiting contemporary urban and ecological conditions.
