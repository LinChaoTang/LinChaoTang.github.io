                    <h2>How Does Climate Become Architecture?</h2>
                    <p>In modern construction logic's pursuit of building performance, tactile experience and microclimate perception of the human body are often overlooked. This project reexamines the embodied wisdom in traditional rammed earth architecture, studying how it creates rich tactile experiences and comfortable microclimates through material properties and constructional details.</p>

                    <p>This studio begins with the relationship between climate and architectural typologies. It identifies representative traditional architectural samples from global climatic typologies and categorizes them based on the distribution of building forms, materials, and climatic conditions such as temperature and humidity.</p>

                    <h2>Tectonic of Rammed Earth Architecture</h2>
                    <p>From a technical perspective, earth has a high specific heat capacity, enabling passive thermal regulation to control indoor temperatures. Once compacted and air-dried, rammed earth also offers structural stability and weather resistance. On a cultural level, earthworks provide tactile experiences through material texture, as well as temperature and humidity sensations.</p>

                    <h2>Form Follows Temperature</h2>
                    <p>By overlaying the time-temperature curves of rammed earth walls with varying thicknesses onto the optimal human comfort temperature for different indoor functions, the suitable wall thickness for each room is defined. The temperature lag effect created by the wall thickness ensures that each room remains at an optimal temperature during human activity.</p>

                    <h2>A Tectonic Fusing Tradition and Modernity</h2>
                    <p>Traditional rammed earth naturally regulates temperature, while modern precast modules enhance stability and streamline construction. Serving as inner molds, these units shape varied wall thicknesses via their recessed and protruding surfaces, enabling large, smooth outer formwork. The method merges structural strength, efficiency, material performance, and cultural symbolism, creating a new tectonic expression that bridges tradition and modernity.</p>
