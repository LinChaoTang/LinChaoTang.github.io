                    <h2>How Can Urban Infrastructure Adapt to a Changing Environment?</h2>
                    <p>In the face of dual challenges from extreme climate and urbanization, contemporary cities are confronting the critical issues of environmental resilience and infrastructure transformation. The Wugu Mountain landfill, as a site bearing the historical imprint of post-war industrialization, not only reflects the environmental impact of human activities but also reveals the crucial role of urban infrastructure in both disaster and daily contexts.</p>

                    <p>Over the past six decades, social and natural meanings have been projected, layered, and evolved in this placeâ€”through agricultural settlements, industrial zones, flood disasters and mitigation infrastructure, and the gentrification struggle across different social strata. This plan is both central and marginal.</p>

                    <p>Each phase of existence is inscribed within the landscape. To the geographic cross-section, archaeological evidence layers from new to old: the Wugu Garbage Mountain formed by industrial waste, concrete bridges, embankment foundations, salt-affected soil from seawater intrusion, and organic-rich soil deposited on the floodplain. These material traces also reflect the rise and fall of social territories.</p>

                    <p>Facing the dual crises of waste pollution and rising water levels, this project proposes a transformative approach to convert hazards into public-benefit landscapes. In the short term, the landfill will be dismantled in phases, with waste repurposed for embankments and waste-to-energy facilities harnessing residual heat. Over time, multifunctional levees and green landscapes will reshape the site into a resilient, ecologically restored riverfront.</p>
