Learning from the Earthworks
Thickness Meets Temperature

How Does Climate Become Architecture?
In modern construction logic's pursuit of building performance, tactile
experience and microclimate perception of the human body are often
overlooked. This project reexamines the embodied wisdom in traditional
rammed earth architecture, studying how it creates rich tactile experiences
and comfortable microclimates through material properties and
constructional details.
Taking Turpan region as the site, through precise analysis of temperaturetime
curves and integration of modern prefabrication technology with
traditional methods, the project develops a new type of sustainable
architecture that responds to human sensory needs at different scales.
From the tactile properties of materials to the regulation of spatial
microclimates, it reestablishes the direct connection between architecture
and the user's body.

Index of Global Climate and
Vernacular Architecture
This studio begins with the relationship between climate and
architectural typologies. It identifies representative traditional
architectural samples from global climatic typologies and categorizes
them based on the distribution of building forms, materials, and climatic
conditions such as temperature and humidity.
This project focuses on thick walls as a point of entry, further
investigating the scale of thick-wall architecture, materials, and their
adaptation to climate change.

Traditional / Modern Approach
Rammed earth architecture embodies ecological, corporeal,
and cultural symbolism, shaping organic traditional
settlements; modern architecture is characterized by high
productivity, efficiency, and dense planning. The intersection
of these two forms represents a sustainable path for the
future of architecture and urban development.

Tectonic of Rammed Earth Architecture
From a technical perspective, earth has a high specific heat
capacity, enabling passive thermal regulation to control
indoor temperatures. Once compacted and air-dried,
rammed earth also offers structural stability and weather
resistance. On a cultural level, earthworks provide tactile
experiences through material texture, as well as temperature
and humidity sensations.

A Tectonic Fusing Tradition and Modernity
Traditional rammed earth naturally regulates temperature,
while modern precast modules enhance stability and
streamline construction. Serving as inner molds, these
units shape varied wall thicknesses via their recessed and
protruding surfaces, enabling large, smooth outer formwork.
The method merges structural strength, efficiency, material
performance, and cultural symbolism, creating a new
tectonic expression that bridges tradition and modernity.
